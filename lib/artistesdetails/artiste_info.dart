He began making music at just ten years old when a fellow classmate at school gave him a copy of the production software FruityLoops. Armed with these means, he began to create his own beats on an old computer. After he graduated, he moved to London to attend university, but he dropped out after two years and moved back to Nigeria. In 2010, the 19-year-old Ogulu traveled to Nigeria's southern coast, where a mutual acquaintance, producer LeriQ, had some studio space. This marked a period when he began to connect to the music of his native country, having spent most of his youth immersed in American acts like DMX. He delved into the dancehall and reggae music his father listened to and explored the Afro-beat music preferred by his grandfather (who had also been Fela Kuti's first manager). As a result of his new discoveries, Ogulu created a confluence of genres that would become his signature sound.",

Thanks to his introspective rap style, his sensitive R&B crooning, and his golden touch with songwriting, each one of his albums -- from 2011's Take Care to 2018's trap-influenced Scorpion -- topped charts worldwide, and singles like the Grammy-winning 'Hotline Bling' and many of his mixtapes did too. As his star rose, he helped others along, sponsoring the Weeknd's early work, starting the OVO Sound label, and giving features on his records to up-and-coming acts. By the second decade of his career, Drake's constant chart domination, his Grammy wins and nominations, and his meme-worthy cultural presence made him one of the world's most popular musicians, and the release of albums like 2022's Honestly, Nevermind became cultural events. \nKnown initially for his role as Jimmy Brooks on Degrassi: The Next Generation, the Toronto-born Aubrey Drake Graham stepped out as a rapper and singer with pop appeal in 2006, when he initiated a series of mixtapes. A year later, despite being unsigned, he scored major exposure when his cocky and laid-back track 'Replacement Girl,' featuring Trey Songz, was featured on BET's 106 & Park program as its 'Joint of the Day.' He raised his profile throughout the next several months by popping up on countless mixtapes and remixes, and as rumors swirled about contract offers from labels, he gradually became one of the most talked-about artists in the industry.

        artistAbout:
            "A multifaceted superstar by any measure, Beyonc√© rose to fame in the late '90s as the central member of pop-R&B group Destiny's Child, and the following decade embarked on a multi-platinum, record-breaking solo career with Dangerously in Love (2003), her first in an unbroken string of number one pop solo albums. Chart-topping singles such as 'Crazy in Love' (2003), 'Irreplaceable' (2006), and 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)' (2008), combined with sold-out world tours and Grammy Awards, all heightened her profile in the 2000s. Billboard named her female artist of the decade, while the RIAA acknowledged that, with 64 gold and platinum certifications, she was the decade's top-selling artist. Once Beyonc√© released her self-titled visual album (2013), it was evident that the powerhouse vocalist, songwriter, and dancer wasn't merely an entertainer but a progressive artist as well. The notion was reaffirmed with her second visual album, Lemonade (2016), the Jay-Z collaboration Everything Is Love (2018), and her work on The Lion King (2019). Beyonc√© expanded the latter project with the executive production of the soundtrack The Lion King: The Gift, and wrote and directed the related musical film Black Is King (2020). With Renaissance (2022), her chart-topping seventh album, Beyonc√© became the most awarded artist in the history of the Grammys.",

            "True to form, Beyonc√© issued a surprise live album, the Grammy-winning Homecoming, in April 2019. Paired with a film of the same title, the set documented her 2018 Coachella performance and added a cover of Maze's 'Before I Let Go.' Later that year, she not only starred as Nala in the photorealistic remake of The Lion King, but curated the film's accompanying soundtrack, The Lion King: The Gift. Featuring a wealth of African artists collaborating with the likes of co-star Donald Glover, Jay-Z, Pharrell Williams, Kendrick Lamar, and Tierra Whack, the album also included her single 'Spirit,' which went on to receive both Grammy and Oscar nominations. Beyonc√© returned to the top of the Hot 100 in May 2020 as a featured artist on Megan Thee Stallion's 'Savage Remix.' Only two months later, she was behind the musical film Black Is King, also her third visual album. She took four awards from the subsequent Grammy ceremony: Best R&B Performance (for the Juneteenth charity single 'Black Parade'), Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance (both for 'Savage'), and Best Music Video ('Brown Skin Girl'). Another soundtrack song, 'Be Alive,' arrived in May 2021 as part of the tennis biopic King Richard. \nIn June 2022, Beyonc√© released 'Break My Soul,' a house track made with 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)' collaborators the-Dream and Tricky Stewart, as the first single off her seventh studio album. The song reached the Top 20 of the Hot 100 before the late July arrival of its parent release, Renaissance. A vibrant and uptempo collection inspired in part by post-'70s Black and queer dance music, Renaissance debuted at number one and in early 2023 earned Beyonc√© four more Grammy Awards, making her the most awarded artist in the organization's history.",

A handful of other guest verses, along with contributions to the soundtracks of Uncle Drew and Superfly, followed in 2018.

Grammy nominations for Rap Album of the Year and Best Rap Song followed shortly thereafter, with 'A Lot' winning Best Rap Song. 21 and Metro Boomin's sequel to Savage Mode arrived in 2020. Narrated in its entirety by actor Morgan Freeman, Savage Mode II retained the gothic mood of its predecessor and added new twists along the way. The set entered the Billboard 200 at number one. 2021 brought the EP Spiral: From the Book of Saw, a short soundtrack accompaniment to the ninth film in the Saw horror series that featured appearances by Young Nudy, Young Thug, and Gunna.

After several years of development, Lamar hit his creative and chart-topping stride in the 2010s. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), the Grammy-winning To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), and the Grammy- and Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN. (2017), his three proper major-label albums, have displayed an unmatched mix of inventive wordplay and compelling conceptual narratives, examining internal conflict, flaunting success, and uplifting his community. The screenplay-level detail of Lamar's writing has been enriched by a collective of producers, instrumentalists, singers, and rappers, a high percentage of whom -- including inspirations Dr. Dre and MC Eiht, and contemporaries Sounwave and Jay Rock -- represent Lamar's native Los Angeles. Lamar's cinematic and collaborative inclinations inevitably attracted the mainstream film industry. Black Panther: The Album (2018) was the source of three of Lamar's Top Ten pop hits. In 2022 he delivered Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, his fifth studio album and what would be his last with Top Dawg Entertainment.",

Remarkably, all 14 of its songs entered the Hot 100, and it was certified multi-platinum within three months. Among the contributors were Rihanna and U2, but at this point, the supporting roles were beneficial more for the guest artists than they were for Lamar, whose artistic clout was unrivaled. Lamar snagged five more Grammys. DAMN. won Best Rap Album. \"HUMBLE.\" took Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and Best Video. Best Rap/Sung Performance went to \"LOYALTY,\" the Rihanna collaboration. Another number one hit followed in February 2018. The soundtrack Black Panther: The Album featured Lamar on every track. \"All the Stars\" (with SZA), \"King's Dead\" (with Jay Rock and Future) and \"Pray for Me\" (with the Weeknd), its three singles, eventually hit the Top Ten. That April, DAMN. won the Pulitzer Prize for Music. It was the first time the judges recognized a work outside the genres of classical and jazz. Months later, \"King's Dead\" made Lamar a 13-time Grammy winner. The track took the award for Best Rap Performance. \"All the Stars\" alone was nominated in four categories, while Black Panther was up for Album of the Year. The film itself was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. After some time away from music that included an acting role on fifth season of the Starz network series Power, Lamar surfaced in 2021 on a series of songs with his cousin Baby Keem. Keem and Lamar's collaborative track \"Family Ties,\" released in August of 2021, won Best Rap Performance at the 2022 Grammys. In February of 2022, Lamar performed at the Super Bowl LVI half time show alongside a crew of rap royalty that included Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Anderson .Paak, and Mary J. Blige. In April of that year he announced his fifth album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, would be arriving the next month. In May he released a new song, \"The Heart, Pt. 5,‚Äù an installment in his ongoing series of The Heart singles that began in 2010. The accompanying video for the non-album track featured Lamar rapping as his face transformed into the likenesses of O.J.

Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers was released in May of 2022 and featured guest appearances from Sampha, Kodak Black, Baby Keem, Portishead‚Äôs Beth Gibbons, and others.

At the award ceremony in 2020, she made history by sweeping those main fields, becoming the second person -- and first since 1981 -- to pull off such a feat. On the heels of her win, Eilish premiered "No Time to Die," her theme song to the 25th James Bond film of the same name.\nLater that summer, Eilish released the R&B-washed "My Future," which became a Top Ten hit on the Hot 100. That August, her 2019 acoustic set Live at Third Man Records received wide release for Record Store Day, rising to number 55 on the Billboard 200 and topping the U.S. Vinyl Albums chart. The single "Therefore I Am" closed out the year, topping charts across the globe. Both tracks landed on her sophomore album, 2021\'s Happier Than Ever. Released in July, the set also featured "Your Power," an indictment of exploitation disguised as an acoustic ballad, and the trip-hop-inflected kiss-off "Lost Cause." With Finneas again handling production, the album unveiled a matured perspective for the artist and added fresh genres to her arsenal, from the aptly titled "Billie Bossa Nova" to the \'90s alternative rock edge of the title track. Happier Than Ever went straight to number one in the U.S., U.K., and several other territories. While on tour for the album, Eilish debuted the song "TV," which she included on her 2022 studio EP Guitar Songs.',

While there was nowhere to go but down, at least in terms of chart positions, the singer, dancer, and occasional rapper was only getting started. Within a few years, Brown became one of the biggest active pop stars with Chris Brown (2005) and Exclusive (2007), multi-platinum albums that produced five more Top Ten singles, including \"Kiss Kiss\" and \"Forever.\" As a featured artist or duettist, he added to the count with hits such as \"No Air,\" a ballad with Jordin Sparks. By the end of the decade, Brown underwent a stylistic makeover during which his forebears shifted to the likes of Jodeci, R. Kelly, and 2Pac. This, and a more drastic change in his public image, did little to slow his commercial momentum. His streak of Top Ten albums was sustained with releases such as Graffiti (2009), the Grammy-winning F.A.M.E. (2011), and Fortune (2012). Brown's artistic scope has since continued to widen with Heartbreak on a Full Moon (2017) and Indigo (2019), albums as long as epic films, and Breezy (2022), his tenth consecutive Top Ten solo LP. \"Summer Too Hot,\" the first single from his next project, appeared in 2023.",

            'Brown cranked out material in larger volumes and made more featured appearances through the end of the 2010s. Heartbreak on a Full Moon arrived in October 2017 with 45 songs on its deluxe edition. It entered the Billboard 200 at number three, making it the artist\'s eighth consecutive Top Ten album. The following year, Brown appeared on a few high-profile collaborative singles, highlighted by Lil Dicky\'s "Freaky Friday," another Top Ten hit. In June 2019, Brown returned with his ninth solo album, the chart-topping double-length Indigo. A track from the LP, "No Guidance," was nominated for a Grammy for Best R&B Song. The commercial mixtape Slime & B, a collaboration with Young Thug, followed in May 2020 and hit number 24 on the Billboard 200. Brown returned in June 2022 with the number four hit Breezy. Aiming to relate more directly to the women in his audience with an emphasis on slow jams and ballads, he also added the likes of Ella Mai and H.E.R. to a supporting cast that included WizKid, Jack Harlow, and Lil Durk. Despite the LP\'s many guests, the unassisted "Iffy" and "WE (Warm Embrace)" were its two first singles to hit the Hot 100. Brown stayed busy in 2023, teaming up with Fridayy on the R&B anthem "Don\'t Give It Away," appearing on Chl√∂e Bailey\'s "How Does It Feel," and giving fans a sneak peek at his forthcoming 11th long-player with the breezy "Summer Too Hot."',
